# Text Editor

A text editor that runs in the browser as a PWA.
## Overview

This application will feature a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application will also function offline.

### This section assumes you have installed the application, and created the .env file in the root directory.

1. Start the server

The server is running, now you can make requests to it through your desired method. If you're new to the backend, I suggest trying out [insomnia](insomnia.com)
